                <h1>WHAT I AM CURRENTLY DOING WITH MY LIFE</h1>
                <strong><small></small></strong>
                <p><ul>I joined Coding Temple in August 2023 because I needed to get more hand on experience in the programing world. I honestly did know any other bootcamps where I would be able to learn as much as possible in just a few short weeks.</ul></p>
                <p><ul>I may have a degree in Information Technology, but the way you build knowledge in the coding world is to have certifications, a website you can provide to potential employers of all the work that you have done over the years.</ul></p>
                <p><ul>Follow me on this wonderful journey as I give you the life of a mother and web developer.</ul></p>
                <p><ul>At the top of the navigation bar, you will see where I will provide education links to all the websites that I use daily along with a blog about what is going on in my daily to day operations as I begin my new journey as a Web Developer.</ul></p>
                <p><ul>I hope you tag along with me for the ride of your life and feel free to reach out to me anytime by any of my social media accounts or email me if you have any questions or comments and I will try to answer them the best way I can.</ul></p>
